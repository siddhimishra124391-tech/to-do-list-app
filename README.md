# to-do-list-app
This project is a static To-Do List interface created using only HTML and CSS. It displays a clean and modern layout where users can see sample tasks along with Add and Delete buttons. As it is made without JavaScript, the design is non-functional and works only as a front-end UI template for a task manager.
